# MyCTiger

MyCTiger transforms the Ring programming language into a powerful domain-specific language (DSL) for generating and executing C programs. It empowers developers to enjoy the performance and efficiency of C while leveraging Ring’s expressive syntax and productivity for DSL creation.
Unlike traditional approaches that embed Ring within C applications or extend the Ring VM using C code, MyCTiger reimagines Ring as a meta-language for authoring C. This isn’t about runtime language integration—it’s about compile-time code generation. With MyCTiger, Ring becomes a high-level interface for producing optimized C code, enabling direct injection of raw C and seamless use of existing C libraries without bindings.

## 🔧 Key Features of MyCTiger

• Compile-Time Ring Execution: Leverage Ring source code during compilation to drive C code generation.
• Meta-Language for C: Treat Ring as a high-level DSL for authoring and structuring C programs.
• Raw C Injection: Seamlessly embed raw C code into the generated output for full control and flexibility.
• Unrestricted C Integration: Use any C source files or libraries directly—no bindings, wrappers, or runtime glue required.
